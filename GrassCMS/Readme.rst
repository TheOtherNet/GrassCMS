GrassCMS, a flask-based html5, drag-and-drop CMS aiming to be the simplest.

Right now, basically, yo can drag and drop your images and documents from the desktop
and place them and resize them as you want. It also features a rich text editor (ckeditor)
with lots of features.
Remember, you don't need to save anything, it's automatic!

Current features:
    - Automagic odt import
    - Txt file import
    - General file uploads with drag-and-drop from the desktop
        - (ODT and any web-viewable image format)
    - Drag and drop and resizable objects
    - On-screen persistence
    - Fixed layout
    - Simple registration via openid
    - Gravatar
    - Simple profile editing
    - Old browsers support via html5shiv
    - Responsive layout (WIP, it still gets a little unusable)
    - Automatic menu generation
